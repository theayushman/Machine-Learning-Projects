## Introduction
### Human activity recognition has become an important area of research in the field of machine learning. The ability to automatically detect and classify human activities has numerous applications, including health monitoring, sports analytics, and behavior analysis.
### In this project, we aim to build a robust and accurate human activity recognition model using smartphone data. The model will take sensor data collected from a smartphone, such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings, and classify the activity being performed by the user.

## Model Training
### To train your own human activity recognition model, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook train.ipynb. This notebook contains the code to preprocess the data, build the model architecture, and train the model using dataset.
### Simply open the train.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions to train the model. You can modify the code and experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters as per your requirements.
